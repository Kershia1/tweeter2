/*
1} Style Header 
The visible portion of the header should have a height of 400px and be 100% the width of its parent container
-nav bar is 120px tall, so make it 520 px tall?
The avatar should be centered vertically and horizontally (Hint: the justify-content and align-items properties are helpful for centering things if you're using Flexbox.)
The name should be centered below the avatar
The background-color should be a different colour than the nav and the body

2} Add a Background Image
Notice how the screen-shot above has a background that is textured. This is because there is a transparent background-image being used. Use this tool to find a background image you like: https://www.transparenttextures.com/ You don't have to make it look exactly like the texture above - choose an image you like!
